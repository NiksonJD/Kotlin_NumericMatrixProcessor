This is the Numeric Matrix Processor (Kotlin) project I made myself.

<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
<p>Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using lists in practice.

Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

 Numeric Matrix Processor (Kotlin) is a graduate project.
